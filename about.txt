REBOL 3 Host-Kit Source Distribution
From REBOL Technologies in Ukiah, California

    Updated: 1-Nov-2010/20:54:56-8:00 

PURPOSE:

The purpose of the R3 Host-Kit is to provide developers with a method of
building custom versions of REBOL, including built-in extension modules.

FEEDBACK:

R3 Chat is the forum for comments, feedback, code changes, and questions.
Type "chat" at the R3 command line. Most users only need to know about
five commands. Type "help" for doc pages, and "?" for a summary.

HOW TO BUILD:

We have included project makefiles for various tool-chains as make-name
directories. They can be run directly from their directories.

If you change any of the .r files you need rebol.exe in your build directory.

That's it for now. Be productive, lean, and quick,

-Carl
